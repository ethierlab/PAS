# PAS
This repo contains functions and scripts to import, process, plot and analyze EMG data acquired from the Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) system, for use in PAS Experiments.

Coding Conventions:
-Each file should have a header dictating the type of code, file name, names of contributors and mm/yy of last update, purpose of the code, and feature list
-Comments should be located beneath each line or code block and should be detailed enough to explain the function of that line or code block
-Global variables should all be declared in the first or second code block
