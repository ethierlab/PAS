Coding Conventions:
* Each file should have a header dictating the type of code, file name, names of contributors and mm/yy of last update, purpose of the code, and feature list
* If the file is a function, then the above should be appended by a description of the input and output variables
* Comments should be located above each code block and should be detailed enough to explain the function of that code block
* Refrain from using whitelines, to ensure code compaction
